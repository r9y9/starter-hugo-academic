A software engineer/researcher at [LY Corporation](https://research.lycorp.co.jp/en).
I am also a Ph.D. student at at Nagoya University, working with my advisor [Prof. Tomoki Toda](https://sites.google.com/site/tomokitoda/home_eng?authuser=0) at the [Toda Laboratory](https://www.toda.is.i.nagoya-u.ac.jp/).

I enjoy both research and software development. My research interests include statistical speech synthesis, voice conversion, singing voice synthesis, and machine learning. Before joining LY Corporation (formerly known as LINE Corporation), I worked in music signal processing, music information retrieval, and computer vision.
