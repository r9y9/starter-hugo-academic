I am a software engineer / researcher at [LINE Corporation](https://engineering.linecorp.com/en/research/).
My research interests include statistical speech synthesis, voice conversion, and machine learning.
Prior to joining LINE Corporation, I worked for music signal processsing, music information retrieval, and computer vision.

In my spare time, I love to write code and enjoy open-source collaboration on [Github](https://github.com/r9y9).
